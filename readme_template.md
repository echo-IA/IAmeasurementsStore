## Dataset name

## Input data used to make these measurements

## Reference publications and conditions of use

## Availability of input catalogues and measurement software


## Sample selection

describe all (sub)sample cuts/selections
details of sky masking

| Sample ID | mean redshift | mean abs mag | mean rest-frame colour | etc.|
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |----------- |
| e.g. L1 | | | | |
| ... | | | | |


## Shape information

describe type of shape measurement method, passband(s) used, calibration applied


## Redshift information

spectroscopic or photometric?
if the latter, decribe photo-z characteristics


## Measurement details

type of IA/clustering estimator, and its settings, e.g. Pi\_max
binning details
how to treat the integral constraint
Fiducial cosmology
H_0 convention
comoving vs. physical coordinates
information on random catalogues and how they were applied
etc.

## Covariances

estimated or modelled?
number of samples if applicable
any corrections when used in likelihood (e.g. inversion)

## Notes

** Add anything that might be relevant to the user **

Consider the following:
- missing data/information, caveats
- independence/shared volume with other IA measurements

Shared volume between different measurements - we have to think about correlations and such.

Systematics corrections applied + data to apply corrections: magnification bias (luminosity function slope), GGL, etc.

## Input data used to make these measurements

Describe the input datasets, perhaps with references.

## Reference publications and conditions of use

Include arxiv numbers

## Availability of input catalogues and measurement software

Include links where possible

## Sample selection

- describe all (sub)sample cuts/selections
- details of sky masking

| Sample ID | mean redshift | mean abs mag | mean rest-frame colour | etc.|
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |----------- |
| e.g. L1 | | | | |
| ... | | | | |

If you can provide full distributions rather than just means, please add these to the repo as ancillatory data and briefly describe here.

## Shape information

describe type of shape measurement method, passband(s) used, calibration applied


## Redshift information

- spectroscopic or photometric?
- if the latter, decribe photo-z characteristics


## Measurement details

- type of IA/clustering estimator, and its settings, e.g. Pi\_max
- binning details
- how to treat the integral constraint
- fiducial cosmology
- H_0 convention
- comoving vs. physical coordinates
- information on random catalogues and how they were applied
- etc.

## Covariances

- estimated or modelled?
- number of samples if applicable
- any corrections when used in likelihood (e.g. correcting inverse covariance estimates)

## Notes

**Add anything that might be relevant to the user**

Consider the following:
- missing data/information, caveats
- parts of the data that should not be (fully) trusted, e.g. covariance on large scales, or clustering on small scales
- independence/shared volume with other IA measurements
- ancillatory data useful for modelling the data, e.g. luminosity function slopes for magnification bias
- recommendations for use, e.g. scale cuts or signals to include
